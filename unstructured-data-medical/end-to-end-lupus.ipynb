    "# Unstructured Text Data: GraphRAG Python package End-to-End Example\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook contains an end-to-end worked example using the [GraphRAG Python package](https://neo4j.com/docs/neo4j-graphrag-python/current/index.html) for Neo4j. It starts with high;y unstructured text data (in this case pdfs), and progresses through knowledge graph construction, knowledge graph retriever design, and complete GraphRAG pipelines. \n",
    "\n",
    "Research papers on Lupus are used as the data source. We design a couple of different retrievers based on different knowledge graph retrieval patterns. \n",
    "\n",
    "For more details and explanations around each of the below steps, see the [corresponding blog post](https://neo4j.com/blog/graphrag-python-package/) which contains a full write-up, in-depth comparison of the retrieval patterns, and additional learning resources. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Pre-Requisites\n",
    "\n",
    "1. __Configure your Environment to Access the Bedrock API__ following this [guide]().\n",
    "2. __Create a Neo4j Database__: To work through this RAG example, you need a database for storing and retrieving data. There are many options for this. You can quickly start a free Neo4j Graph Database using [Neo4j AuraDB](https://neo4j.com/product/auradb/?ref=neo4j-home-hero). You can use __AuraDB Free__ or start an __AuraDB Professional (Pro) free trial__ for higher ingestion and retrieval performance. The Pro instances have a bit more RAM; we recommend them for the best user experience.\n",
    "3. __Fill in Credentials__: Either by copying the [`.env.template`](cred.env.template) file, naming it `.env`, and filling in the appropriate credentials, or by manually putting the credentials into the second code cell below. You will need the Neo4j URI, username, and password variables from when you created the database. If you created your database on AuraDB, they are in the file you downloaded.\n",

Knowledge of its epidemiology,\\ngenetic susceptibility and pathophysiologic mechanisms has evolved, but it remains\\na disease with a highly variable course and considerable inter-individual variability.\\nIt has an unpredictable prognosis, depending mainly on the severity of the disease\\nactivity, organ damage and response to treatment. SLE is characterized by loss of\\nself-immune tolerance, production of self-reacting antibodies and formation of\\nimmune complexes (IC) that precipitate in tissues, causing chronic systemic in\\ufb02am-\\nmation and organ damage.1 It affects primarily women (90%) during childbearing\\nyears and \"\n",

Due to its complexity and heterogeneity, SLE is not a single-target disease, and many aspects must be taken into consideration in \\nthe management of the disease: controlling disease activity, preventing damage accrual, minimizing treatment-related toxicities, and \\nimproving patients ’ quality of life (QoL). \\nSince when the principle of “ treat to target ” (T2T) has been applied in SLE [ 3 ], many efforts have been made to define targets in \\nSLE. Over the last few years, the DORIS definition of remission [ 4 , 5 ] and the LLDAS definition of Lupus Low Disease Activity [ 6 ] have \\nemerged as the most meaningful treatment targets, after multiple validation studies in large independent cohorts. \\nThe physicians ’ view on lupus dominated the development of remission criteria and it was postulated that a control of disease \\nactivity would improve QoL in SLE, although the definitions of remission and LLDAS do not address Health-Related Quality of Life \\n(HRQoL) or disease burden. \\nWhile some studies have demonstrated an association between a stable condition of remission or LLDAS and better HRQoL in SLE \\npatients, this may sometimes prove to be a weak association [ 7 ]. \\nThe disease imposes a great burden on patient ’ s lives and 35 – 50% of patients with SLE perceive their health as “ fair/not so good ” or \\n* Corresponding author.

In this review, we\\nattempt to capture the major immunological changes linked to the pathophysiology of lupus\\nand discuss the challenge it presents in moving towards the concept of precision medicine.\\nCurrently broadly similar types of drugs, e.g., steroids, immunosuppressives, hydroxychlor-\\noquine are used to treat many of the diverse clinical features of SLE. We suspect that, as the\\nprecise immunopathological abnormalities differ between the various organs/systems in\\nlupus patients, it will be some time before precision medicine can be fully applied to SLE.\\nKeywords: systemic lupus erythematosus, anti-DNA antibodies, lupus nephritis, lupus\\ngenetics, immunosuppression\\nIntroduction\\nSystemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic, complex, auto-immune disease of\\nunknown origin with multiorgan involvement. Knowledge of its epidemiology,\\ngenetic susceptibility and pathophysiologic mechanisms has evolved, but it remains\\na disease with a highly variable course and considerable inter-individual variability.\\nIt has an unpredictable prognosis, depending mainly on the severity of the disease\\nactivity, organ damage and response to treatment. SLE is characterized by loss of\\nself-immune tolerance, production of self-reacting antibodies and formation of\\nimmune complexes (IC) that precipitate in tissues, causing chronic systemic inﬂam-\\nmation and organ damage.1 It affects primarily women (90%) during childbearing\\nyears and \\n\\n=== kg_rels ===\\nAmerican College of Rheumatology - DESCRIBES(Developed classification criteria for disease) -> Systemic Lupus Erythematosus\n",
